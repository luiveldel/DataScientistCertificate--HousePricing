# DataCamp Data Scientist Certification Case Study

### Project Brief

You have been hired by Inn the Neighborhood, an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties for short stays. Currently, the webpage for renters has a conversion rate of 2%. This means that most people leave the platform without signing up. 

The product manager would like to increase this conversion rate. They are interested in developing an application to help people estimate the money they could earn renting out their living space. They hope that this would make people more likely to sign up.

The company has provided you with a dataset that includes details about each property rented, as well as the price charged per night. They want to avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price, as this may discourage people.

You will need to present your findings in two formats:
- You must submit a written report summarising your analysis to your manager. As a data science manager, your manager has a strong technical background and wants to understand what you have done and why. 
- You will then need to share your findings with the product manager in a 10 minute presentation. The product manager has no data science background but is familiar with basic data related terminology. 

The data you will use for this analysis can be accessed here: `"rentals.csv"`

#### We want to predict the 'price' with +25 error using the other features. Given the red, predict the blue:

#### Our main GOAL: predict the price based on their characteristics. This a regression problem because we try to predict a continuous value instead of a binary one.
